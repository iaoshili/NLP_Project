At what point does artificial intelligence meet or surpass the level of human intelligence?
Thatâ€™s a question thatâ€™s been bouncing around the halls of computer science (and science fiction) for decades. The existing go-to system â€” called the Turing Test, after pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing â€” requires that a machine be able to essentially fool a human in one-on-one conversation.
Mark O. Riedl, computer researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology, has proposed a new kind of test focused on the idea of artistic creativity. The Lovelace 2.0 test would require an aspiring A.I. machine to create a range of creative works â€” paintings, stories, poems, architectural designs â€” that expert and unbiased observers would conclude were designed by a human.
Itâ€™s not a precisely new idea, as that 2.0 designation suggests. The concept is a variation on a 2001 proposal that also focuses on the idea of creativity in human intelligence. The original Lovelace test requires an A.I. machine to produce a work of art in such a way that the machineâ€™s designers canâ€™t explain how it happened.
Riedl, associate professor and director of Georgia Techâ€™s Entertainment Intelligence Lab , contends that the 1.0 test is flawed â€” in that the designers would always be able to deduce how the art was created. Instead, he suggests a more complex methodology which hews closer to the Turing Test. If a robot can make art indistinguishable from that of a human â€” to an expert outside evaluator under specified conditions â€” then the machine has achieved human-level intelligence.
â€œMany forms of creativity necessitate intelligence,â€� Riedl writes in his proposal. â€œIn the spirit of [the Turning Test] the Lovelace 2.0 Test asks that artificial agents comprehend instruction and create at the amateur level.â€�
On a lark, we ran the Lovelace Test on our central supercomputer here at Discovery News HQ, SAL 9000,Â to see if he could create a poem. As usual, SAL took the opportunity to crack wise. An uncommonly sarcastic supercomputer, our SAL.
