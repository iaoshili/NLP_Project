âHello, this is a Tinder robot. Would you like to meet for a romantic candlelit date?â
Robots clean our floors, mow our lawns and (at least in Japan) check you into hotel rooms and carry your luggage.
So why not turn over that pesky problem of setting up a date to a bot?
Vancouver developer and Tinder user Justin Long did just that, creating software that puts the popular dating app Tinder on auto pilot.
Tired of the time he spent swiping right and left to say yes or no on the popular app, Long combined facial recognition and artificial intelligence to let his bot â dubbed Tinderbox â prescreen potential dating partners.
Tinderbox not only decides for you based on the photos that pop up in your Tinder app, itâll also strike up conversations with the people it thinks youâll like.
âThe inspiration actually wasnât just from me, it was also from my friends,â said Long. âI found that we were really getting sucked into it.
âI donât have the time to spend all day swiping left and rightâ¦.But when I would be sucked in Iâd estimate Iâd easily go through 300 swipes an hour.â
âIt was just something I didnât want to spend that much time doing, but you have to if you want to have success.â
Using machine learning, after considering about 60 yes-or-no choices you make on the popular dating software, Tinderbox is ready to choose for you.
â(The bot) works how Tinder works, it swipes left or right and if thereâs a match, it will send a conversation starter,â said Long.
Opening lines that elicited the most favourable responses on Tinder?
âDo you like avocados?â
âCan you teach a guy to bake and all that?â
âI canât wait to show you to my mom.â
If you say you like avocados, the bot was programmed to respond: âWell then you wouldnât mind doing a romantic candlelit guacamole date down by the seawall.â
Long programmed various responses but found he had to jump in and take over from the bot if the conversation were to continue.
âThere were no actual guacamole dates down by the seawall, but itâs a good joke,â he said.
Long said it usually takes at least 10 back-and-forth messages before you can actually set up a date on Tinder. Plus, he thinks itâs worth actually conversing with a person before going on a date.
âIt would be weird for me if the bot went as far as to make a table reservation somewhere and actually set up a date,â he said.
Its success rate?
The sample size is admittedly small. Long has made the code for Tinderbox available on Github with a non-commercial license, so for personal use other techies can try it or modify it.
But so far we have only Longâs experience to go by.
He estimates he's gone on 10 dates with people Tinderbox chose for him and one person heâs still seeing.
A bot that sets up dates for you â  creepy or convenient?
Long said he told all his dates about Tinderbox and nine out of 10 didnât find it creepy.
He has no plans to commercialize the software but he said he thought it not only be useful, but thought-provoking.
âIs it creepy or is it good?â said Long.
