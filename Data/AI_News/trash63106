Rarely does a day go by without mention of a new kind of robot popping up in the science headlines. We even keep an entire  topic heading  on the subject here at Discovery News.  But if the robot revolution really does come to pass, the machines aren't likely to swoop down on us in some sudden and terrifying  Terminator  scenario. Instead, they'll rise up calmly from the weird places they've been secretly infiltrating. Here we take a look at some of the unexpected places where robots have already staked out positions.

Cooki robotic chef , pictured here, are starting to make their way into both home and restaurant kitchens. The Cooki prototype displayed at this year's Consumer Electronics Show is able to prepare an entire meal from ingredients loaded into side-mounted trays.

Most public and university libraries now have self-checkout kiosks and other automated systems for checking out books. But North Carolina State's  bookBot  delivery system takes it up a notch, using robotic arms to pull items from within a giant stack of storage bins. University officials say the system requires only about 10 percent of the space of conventional shelving.

Scientists at the United Technologies Research Center in Berkeley, Calif., recently unveiled their latest A.I. triumph -- a  laundry robot  that can gather, wash and fold clothes. The team has also taught the bot how to fetch a beer. When this robot turns on us, it's going to be heartbreaking.

Designed to experiment and learn from its mistakes, the robot behind IBM's  Cognitive Cooking  initiative is actually an advanced A.I. from the same team that brought us Jeopardy champ  Watson . Dishes invented by the bot include Belgian Bacon Pudding and the frankly alarming Austrian Chocolate Burrito. IBM's dedicated food truck can often be found at industry events, serving up the computer-designed vittles.

Not all robots are hi-tech, but when they're this big, they don't really need to be. Tourists visiting the French city of Nantes can check out -- and even ride -- the Great Elephant robot, made from 45 tons of wood and steel. The robot is one of several mechanical marvels built by resident artists in the city's former shipyards.

Royal Caribbean has installed a robotic bartender on its cruise liner  Quantum of the Seas , which shakes and stirs martinis and other drinks using articulated robot arms. Customers place their orders from table-mounted tablets. In fact, several forward-thinking establishments have deployed robot bartenders, including The  Robots Bar and Lounge  in Illmenau, Germany.

Pharmacies in the UCSF Medical Center in California have been using robots to fill prescriptions for several years now. Statistically, the automated system is less prone to error, administrators say, plus the bots can safely handle dangerous substances like toxic chemotherapy drugs.

Last summer, research teams from two Canadian universities unleashed hitchBOT -- a hitchhiking robot that managed to make its way across the entire country in 21 days. The bot was equipped with an LED screen "face" and gear for communicating with its handlers and posting videos online. HitchBOT is part of a social sciences project studying interactive robots and the psychology of human kindness.

Not a lot of people know this, but many stories in print and online publications are actually written by robots. The Associated Press uses "automation technology" to generate certain kinds of financial reports and sports stories that essentially consist of number-crunching and boilerplate text. A good chunk of the write-ups on Wikipedia are automated, as well. As a matter of fact, this entire slideshow was written and compiled by our new Discovery News Blog-Tron 6000. We kid, we kid.

For those craving a juicy tomato while running (anyone?), life could get a whole lot sweeter.
Developed by a Japanese ketchup and tomato sauce company named Kagome, the so-called Tomatan is a humanoid-looking backpack that sits on an athleteâ€™s shoulders and serves up tomatoes to eat during a race or marathon.
The hands-free robot has a tomato-shaped head with a mouth that opens to dispense a tomato. Metal arms latch on to the fruit and come down over an individualâ€™s mouth to feed them. Â The robot can be loaded with six mid-sized tomatoes.
Runners would have to carry some extra weight (the device weighs in at 18 pounds), but makers claim the tomatoes, packed with nutrition, could help combat fatigue.
Kagome collaborated with Japanese art studio Maywa Denki, which is known for its work in musical instruments, for the robotâ€™s visual design.
The Tomatan will make an appearance, sitting atop the shoulders of Kagome employee Shigenori Suzuki, during a three-mile run in Tokyo on Sunday, Feb. 21.
Another employee from Kagome will run with the 6.6-pound Petit-Tomatan, a lighter wearable tomato-dispensing robot, in the Tokyo Marathon this weekend.
Apparently this wacky invention could have some competition in the wearable food-inspired gadget category during this weekendâ€™s races. Doleâ€™s Japan division will debut a smartwatch , made of banana, that through a LED display and built-in GPS will display time, heart rate and even tweets. Whatâ€™s more, runners can peel the banana and eat the fruit inside once they cross the finish line.
