Sze’s group, the Energy-Efficient Multimedia Systems, is working to develop technologies to enable energy-efficient and high-performance systems for visual data processing such as video coding, imaging, and computer vision. The group focuses on joint design across various levels of abstraction, from energy-aware algorithm development for signal processing to efficient architecture design and low-power, very-large-scale integration circuit implementation to enable optimal tradeoffs between power, speed, and quality of result.
With the goal of energy-efficient systems for a wide range of applications, Sze’s group has designed hardware that performs real-time object detection and video decoding on high-definition video content while consuming less than a nanojoule per pixel. Enabling real-time energy-efficient visual data processing can not only benefit many of today's portable-multimedia applications (phone, tablet, etc.), but can impact a wide range of emerging video-based applications ranging from improved safety through elderly assistance, advanced driver assistance systems, and crime prevention to increased efficiency through structural monitoring, smart homes, unmanned vehicles, and traffic control.
