The Vision Systems Design team is currently in the process of developing an industry survey that aims to identify some of the main hurdles that systems integrators and engineers may encounter when it comes to the design, implementation, and maintenance of imaging systems.
We plan to publish the data gathered from this survey, along with an analysis for our reader community of visiion industry professionals. So, we really want to know what you want to know. We have identified a number of the aforementioned hurdles and hindrances.These include product selection (production evaluation and specifications, quality assessment, lack of standards), operational limitations (accurate deliverability schedule, accurate definition of project/specs, maintaining product delivery schedule), and factors such as bidding processes and project restrictions. However, within the machine vision and image processing industries are a vast number of different markets, applications, and product types, so we must ensure we have a comprehensive survey.
