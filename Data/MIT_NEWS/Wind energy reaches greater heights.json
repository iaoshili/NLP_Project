{"content": "Wind turbines across the globe are being made taller to capture more energy from the stronger winds that blow at greater heights.\nBut it\u2019s not easy, or sometimes even economically feasible, to build taller towers, with shipping constraints on tower diameters and the expense involved in construction.\nNow Keystone Tower Systems \u2014 co-founded by Eric Smith \u201901, SM \u201907, Rosalind Takata \u201900, SM \u201906, and Alexander Slocum, the Pappalardo Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT \u2014 is developing a novel system that adapts a traditional pipe-making technology to churn out wind turbines on location, at wind farms, making taller towers more economically feasible. \nKeystone\u2019s system is a modification of spiral welding, a process that\u2019s been used for decades to make large pipes. In that process, steel sheets are fed into one side of a machine, where they\u2019re continuously rolled into a spiral, while their edges are welded together to create a pipe \u2014 sort of like a massive paper-towel tube.\nDeveloped by Smith, Takata, and Slocum \u2014 along with a team of engineers, including Daniel Bridgers SM \u201912 and Dan Ainge \u201912 \u2014 Keystone\u2019s system allows the steel rolls to be tapered and made of varying thickness, to create a conical tower. The system is highly automated \u2014 using about one-tenth the labor of traditional construction \u2014 and uses steel to make the whole tower, instead of concrete. \u201cThis makes it much more cost-effective to build much taller towers,\u201d says Smith, Keystone\u2019s CEO.\nWith Keystone\u2019s onsite fabrication, Smith says, manufactures can make towers that reach more than 400 feet. Wind that high can be up to 50 percent stronger and, moreover, isn\u2019t blocked by trees, Smith says. A 460-foot tower, for instance, could increase energy capture by 10 to 50 percent, compared with today\u2019s more common 260-foot towers.\n\u201cThat\u2019s site-dependent,\u201d Smith adds. \u201cIf you go somewhere in the Midwest where there\u2019s open plains, but no trees, you\u2019re going to see a benefit, but it might not be a large benefit. But if you go somewhere with tree cover, like in Maine \u2014 because the trees slow down the wind near the ground \u2014 you can see a 50 percent increase in energy capture for the same wind turbine.\u201d\nSolving transport problems\nThe Keystone system\u2019s value lies in skirting wind-turbine transportation constraints that have plagued the industry for years. Towers are made in segments to be shipped to wind farms for assembly. But they\u2019re restricted to diameters of about 14 feet, so trucks can safely haul them on highways and under bridges.\nThis means that in the United States, most towers for 2- or 3-megawatt turbines are limited to about 260 feet. In Europe, taller towers (up to about 460 feet) are becoming common, but these require significant structural or manufacturing compromises: They\u2019re built using very thick steel walls at the base (requiring more than 100 tons of excess steel), or with the lower half of the tower needing more than 1,000 tons of concrete blocks, or pieced together with many steel elements using thousands of bolts.\n\u201cIf you were to design a 500-foot tower to get strong winds, based on the force exerted on a turbine, you\u2019d want something at least 20 feet in diameter at the base,\u201d Smith explains. \u201cBut there\u2019s no way to weld together a tower in a factory that\u2019s 20 feet in diameter and ship it to the wind farm.\u201d\nInstead, Keystone delivers its mobile, industrial-sized machine and the trapezoid-shaped sheets of steel needed to feed into the system. Essentially, the sheets are trapezoids of increasing sizes \u2014 with the shorter size fed into the machine first, and the longest piece fed in last. (If you laid all the sheets flat, edge-to-edge, they\u2019d form an involute spiral.) Welding their edges assembles the sheets into a conical shape. The machine can make about one tower per day.\nAny diameter is possible, Smith says. For 450-foot, 3-megawatt towers, a base 20 feet in diameter will suffice. (Increasing diameters by even a few feet, he says, can make towers almost twice as strong to handle stress.)\nSmith compares the process to today\u2019s at-home installation of rain gutters: For that process, professionals drive to a house and feed aluminum coils into one end of a specialized machine that shapes the metal into a seamless gutter. \u201cIt\u2019s a better alternative to buying individual sections and bringing them home to assemble,\u201d he says. \u201cKeystone\u2019s system is that, but on a far, far grander scale.\u201d\nBehind Keystone\nSmith, who studied mechanical engineering and electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, conceived of a tapered spiral-welding process while conducting an independent study on wind-energy issues with Slocum.\nRunning a consulting company for machine design after graduating from MIT, Smith was vetting startups and technologies in wind energy, and other industries, for investors. As wind energy picked up steam about five years ago, venture capitalists soon funded Smith, Slocum, and other wind-energy experts to study opportunities for cost savings in large, onshore wind turbines.\nThe team looked, for instance, at developing advanced drivetrain controls and rotor designs. \u201cBut out of that study we spotted tower transport as one of the biggest bottlenecks holding back the industry,\u201d Smith says.\nWith Slocum\u2019s help, Smith worked out how to manipulate spiral-welding machines to make tapered tubes and, soon thereafter, along with Slocum, designed a small-scale, patented machine funded by a $1 million Department of Energy grant. In 2010, Smith and Slocum launched Keystone with Rosalind Takata \u201901, SM \u201906 to further develop the system in Somerville, Mass. The company has since relocated its headquarters to Denver.\nIn launching Keystone, Smith gives some credit to MIT\u2019s Venture Mentoring Service (VMS), which advised the startup\u2019s co-founders on everything from early company formation to scaling up the business. Smith still keeps in touch with VMS for advice on overcoming common commercialization roadblocks, such as obtaining and maintaining customers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been extremely valuable,\u201d he says of VMS. \u201cThere are many different topics that come up when you\u2019re founding an early-stage company, and it\u2019s good to have advisors who\u2019ve seen it all before.\u201d\nOpening up the country\nKeystone is now conducting structural validation of towers created by its system in collaboration with structural engineers at Northeastern University and Johns Hopkins University. For the past year, the startup\u2019s been working toward deploying a small-scale prototype (about six stories high) at the MIT-owned Bates Linear Accelerator Center in Middleton, Mass., by early 2015.\nBut last month, Keystone received another $1 million DOE grant to design the full mobile operation. Now, the company is working with the Danish wind-turbine manufacturer Vestas Wind Systems, and other turbine makers, to plan out full-scale production, and is raising investments to construct the first commercial scale machine.\nAlthough their first stops may be Germany and Sweden \u2014 where taller wind towers are built more frequently, but using more expensive traditional methods \u2014 Smith says he hopes to sell the system in the United States, where shorter towers (around 260 feet) are still the norm.\nThe earliest adopters in the United States, he says, would probably be areas where there is strong wind, but also dense tree cover. In Maine, for example, there\u2019s only a small percentage of the state where wind power is economically feasible today, because trees block wind from the state\u2019s shorter turbines. In the Midwest, wind energy has already reached grid-parity, undercutting even today\u2019s low-cost natural gas \u2014 but in areas like New England and the Southeast, taller towers are needed to reach the strong winds that make wind energy economically feasible.\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re at the heights we\u2019re looking at,\u201d Smith says, \u201cit really opens up the whole country for turbines to capture large amounts of energy.\u201d", "tags": ["School of Engineering", "Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (eecs)", "Mechanical engineering", "Startups", "Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&E)", "Wind", "wind energy", "Energy", "Alumni/ae"], "title": "Wind energy reaches greater heights"}
