{"content": "Financial innovation is supposed to reduce risk \u2014 in theory, at least. Yes, new financial instruments based on the housing market helped cause the financial crisis of 2008. But in the abstract, those same instruments have the potential to spread risk more evenly throughout the marketplace by making it possible to trade debt more extensively, rather than having it concentrated in a relatively few hands.\nNow a paper published by MIT economist Alp Simsek makes the case that even in theory, financial innovation does not lower portfolio risk. Instead, it raises portfolio risks by creating situations in which parties sit on opposing sides of deep disagreements about the value of certain investments.\n\u201cIn a world in which investors have different views, new securities won\u2019t necessarily reduce risks,\u201d says Simsek, an assistant professor in MIT\u2019s Department of Economics. \u201cPeople bet on their views. And betting is inherently a risk-increasing activity.\u201d\nIn a paper published this month in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, titled \u201cSpeculation and Risk Sharing with New Financial Assets,\u201d Simsek details why he thinks this is the case. The risk in portfolios, he argues, needs to be divided into two categories: the kind of risk that is simply inherent in any real-world investment, and a second type he calls \u201cspeculative variance,\u201d which applies precisely to new financial instruments designed to generate bets based on opposing worldviews.\nTo be clear, Simsek notes, financial innovation may have other benefits \u2014 it may spread information around world markets, for instance \u2014 but it is not going to lead to lower risks for investors as a whole.\n\u201cFinancial innovation might be good for other reasons, but this general kind of belief that it reduces the risks in the economy is not right,\u201d Simsek says. \u201cAnd I want people to realize that.\u201d\nWe beg to differ\nTo see why financial innovation is supposed to reduce risk \u2014 and why Simsek argues that it does not \u2014 consider the family of instruments based around home mortgages. These include the mortgage-backed security, which is a bundle of mortgages sold as a bond; the collateralized debt obligation, which is a bundle of mortgage-backed securities; and the credit default swap, which is basically insurance on these kinds of debt.\nIn theory, wrapping a bunch of mortgages into a bond and selling it on the markets spreads risk around and could lead to lower mortgage rates. Since the bank or lending institution no longer has to hold all the loans, it is both less vulnerable and \u2014 not having to worry as much about defaults \u2014 may be in a better position to loan at lower rates.\nMoreover, these kinds of financial instruments separate home loans into distinct tranches, based on apparent risk \u2014 meaning that hedge funds with high risk tolerance could acquire the higher-paying, riskier loans, and pension funds could acquire the seemingly safer tranches.\nAny investment in mortgages will contain a certain amount of risk, since no one can be completely certain what the future holds for the housing market. But now consider what occurs when the credit default swap enters the mix. This is essentially a side bet between parties \u2014 such as banks and reinsurance companies \u2014 about the future of the housing market, and it will produce a winner and a loser. The wager represents precisely the kind of speculative variance, in Simsek\u2019s term, that stems from a \u201cbelief disagreement.\u201d\nAs it happens, Simsek believes that a closer analysis of the standard tool used to evaluate portfolio risk, the capital-asset pricing model (CAPM) in use since the 1960s, reveals that this kind of distinction is inherent in its equations.\n\u201cIf you do the math, [portfolio risk] naturally breaks down into two components,\u201d Simsek says \u2014 the inherent risk of investing, and speculative variance. His current paper is thus a mathematical demonstration of the idea that, using this widely accepted mode of analyzing risk, \u201cas you increase assets, this speculative part always goes up,\u201d as he explains, and that \u201cwhen disagreements are large enough, this second effect is dominant and you end up increasing the average [portfolio risks] as well.\u201d\nModel research\nTo be sure, Simsek\u2019s conclusion is based on a model. However, modeling is a significant part of economics; the right model can help describe and illuminate complex realities.  \n\u201cYou build models, and if you\u2019re lucky enough, the model speaks back,\u201d Simsek says.\nMoreover, the disastrous results of financial innovations related to the housing market in recent years suggested to him that some rethinking of risk theory was in order. \u201cWhat happened at the time seemed inconsistent to me with what we learned in finance courses,\u201d says Simsek, referring to the investment bubble that sank prominent Wall Street firms and required a huge government bailout.\nThat is not to say that housing or the bond market are the only areas where speculative variance can be found; as Simsek points out, commodities markets, with their many futures contracts, are an obvious place to find bets based on belief disagreement and expressed through innovative financial tools. \nOther economists are impressed by the paper. \u201cHe goes deep and he\u2019s very careful and rigorous and clear,\u201d says Darrell Duffie, a professor of finance at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business, who commented on the paper at this year\u2019s meeting of the American Economic Association.\nAs Duffie notes, there have been many papers published about belief disagreements, and much work done on financial innovation, \u201cbut as far as I know this is the only paper that puts the two together.\u201d The paper also suggests a need for further empirical research, he says, to test Simsek\u2019s theory about belief disagreement and speculative variance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pure theory paper, so you often want to have someone come along afterward and measure empirically how big the effect is,\u201d Duffie says.\nFor his part, Simsek says, he would be happy to see empirical research probing his model. It would be beneficial, he thinks, for economists \u201cto engage in a quantitative analysis, asset by asset, to think about the net effect [of speculative variance]. That\u2019s a tough question, but one I think we should tackle going forward.\u201d", "tags": ["Economics", "Humanities", "Investing", "Risk analysis", "Social sciences", "Stock Market", "Finance"], "title": "Rethinking investment risk"}
