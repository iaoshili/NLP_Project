{"content": "Scientists have crunched data to predict crime, hospital visits, and government uprisings \u2014 so why not the price of Bitcoin?\nA researcher at MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems recently developed a machine-learning algorithm that can predict the price of the infamously volatile cryptocurrency Bitcoin, allowing his team to nearly double its investment over a period of 50 days.\nEarlier this year, principal investigator Devavrat Shah and recent graduate Kang Zhang collected price data from all major Bitcoin exchanges, every second for five months, accumulating more than 200 million data points.\nUsing a technique called \u201cBayesian regression,\u201d they trained an algorithm to automatically identify patterns from the data, which they used to predict prices, and trade accordingly.\nSpecifically, every two seconds they predicted the average price movement over the following 10 seconds. If the price movement was higher than a certain threshold, they bought a Bitcoin; if it was lower than the opposite threshold, they sold one; and if it was in-between, they did nothing.\nOver 50 days, the team\u2019s 2,872 trades gave them an 89 percent return on investment with a Sharpe ratio (measure of return relative to the amount of risk) of 4.1.\nThe team\u2019s paper was published this month at the 2014 Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing.\n\u201cWe developed this method of latent-source modeling, which hinges on the notion that things only happen in a few different ways,\u201d says Shah, who previously used the approach to predict Twitter trending topics. \u201cInstead of making subjective assumptions about the shape of patterns, we simply take the historical data and plug it into our predictive model to see what emerges.\u201d\nShah says he was drawn to Bitcoin because of its vast swath of free data, as well as its sizable user base of high-frequency traders.\n\u201cWe needed publicly available data, in large quantities and at an extremely fine scale,\u201d says Shah, the Jamieson Career Development Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. \u201cWe were also intrigued by the challenge of predicting a currency that has seen its prices see-saw regularly in the last few years.\u201d\nIn the future, Shah says he is interested in expanding the scale of the data collection to further hone the effectiveness of his algorithm.\n\u201cCan we explain the price variation in terms of factors related to the human world? We have not spent a lot of time doing that,\u201d Shah says, before adding with a laugh, \u201cBut I can show you it works. Give me your money and I\u2019d be happy to invest it for you.\u201d\nWhen Shah published his Twitter study in 2012, some academics wondered whether his approach could work for stock prices. With the Bitcoin research complete, he says he now feels confident modeling virtually any quantity that varies over time \u2014 including, he says half-jokingly, the validity of astrology predictions.\nIf nothing else, the findings demonstrate Shah\u2019s belief that, more often than not, what gets in the way of our predictive powers are our preconceived notions of what patterns will pop up.\n\u201cWhen you get down to it,\u201d he says, \u201cyou really should be letting the data decide.\u201d", "tags": ["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)", "Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)", "Machine learning", "Investing", "Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (eecs)", "School of Engineering", "Algorithms", "Computer science and technology", "Big data", ""], "title": "MIT computer scientists can predict the price of Bitcoin"}
