What O
is O
the O

The O
deadline O
for O
admission O
in O
the O
fall O
term O
, O
2015 O
, O
is O
January O
2 O
, O
2015 O
. O
There O
is O
no O
way O
to O
apply O
starting O
in O
the O
spring O
term O
, O
although O
once O
a O
student O
is O
admitted O
it O
is O
sometimes O
possible O
to O
delay O
admission O
for O
a O
year O
or O
possibly O
less O
, O
with O
permission O
from O
the O
Dean O
of O
the O
Graduate O
School O
. O
What O
does O
the O
department O
do O
with O
GRE O
Scores O
? O
Can O
you O
tell O
me O
the O
range O
of O
scores O
for O
students O
admitted O
in O
recent O
years O
? O
We O
attach O
importance O
to O
GRE O
scores O
, O
but O
only O
in O
the O
context O
of O
a O
student O
's O
overall O
record O
. O
Publishing O
a O
minimum O
threshold O
would O
be O
pointless O
. O
Most O
students O
we O
admit O
are O
above O
the O
90th O
percentile O
in O
quantitative O
, O
analytical O
and O
verbal O
scores O
. O
The O
important O
thing O
to O
remember O
is O
that O
the O
admissions O
committee O
looks O
at O
the O
entire O
application O
packet O
: O
the O
transcripts O
, O
the O
test O
scores O
, O
letters O
of O
recommendation O
-- O
whatever O
gives O
us O
insight O
into O
the O
applicant O
's O
promise O
as O
a O
researcher O
. O
What O
about O
grades O
? O
Again O
, O
it O
is O
good O
to O
have O
high O
grades O
, O
but O
we O
actually O
look O
at O
transcripts O
. O
If O
a O
student O
has O
a O
low O
grade-point O
average O
, O
we O
check O
to O
see O
if O
perhaps O
he O
or O
she O
did O
badly O
early O
in O
college O
, O
possibly O
through O
lack O
of O
motivation O
, O
then O
did O
better O
as O
intellectual O
curiosity O
grew O
. O
Or O
perhaps O
someone O
's O
grades O
are O
low O
because O
he O
or O
she O
focused O
entirely O
on O
computer O
science O
and O
received O
bad O
grades O
in O
everything O
else O
. O
-LRB- O
Is O
that O
good O
? O
It O
's O
impossible O
to O
answer O
without O
looking O
at O
the O
students O
' O
entire O
record O
. O
-RRB- O
How O
important O
are O
TOEFL O
scores O
to O
foreign O
students O
? O
Very O
important O
, O
but O
only O
because O
we O
have O
nothing O
better O
. O
Your O
goal O
before O
admission O
should O
be O
to O
learn O
English O
, O
not O
to O
pass O
the O
TOEFL O
. O
Yale O
University O
attaches O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
importance O
to O
the O
process O
by O
which O
graduate O
students O
learn O
to O
become O
teachers O
. O
Every O
student O
is O
required O
to O
TA O
two O
terms O
, O
and O
may O
TA O
more O
terms O
if O
desired O
. O
Being O
an O
instructor O
or O
assisting O
one O
requires O
interactions O
with O
undergraduate O
students O
. O
Yale O
administers O
its O
own O
test O
-LRB- O
the O
`` O
SPEAK O
Test O
'' O
-RRB- O
to O
students O
after O
they O
get O
here O
to O
be O
sure O
they O
know O
English O
well O
enough O
to O
talk O
to O
undergraduates O
. O
Failure O
to O
pass O
this O
test O
causes O
administrative O
problems O
for O
faculty O
and O
graduate O
students O
. O
The O
test O
is O
waived O
for O
students O
with O
a O
4-year O
degree O
from O
an O
institution O
where O
English O
is O
the O
primary O
language O
of O
instruction O
; O
and O
for O
students O
who O
score O
26 O
or O
higher O
on O
the O
spoken O
portion O
of O
the O
iBT O
test O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
major O
in O
Computer O
Science O
as O
an O
undergraduate O
. O
Can O
I O
still O
get O
in O
? O
Yes O
. O
It O
helps O
to O
have O
a O
serious O
, O
specific O
interest O
in O
some O
aspect O
of O
the O
science O
of O
computing O
, O
over O
and O
above O
experience O
in O
programming O
computers O
. O
If O
you O
are O
unacquainted O
with O
complexity O
and O
decidability O
, O
or O
have O
only O
cursory O
knowledge O
of O
data O
structures O
, O
or O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
difference O
between O
an O
algorithm O
and O
a O
program O
, O
then O
you O
should O
consider O
taking O
-LRB- O
and O
doing O
well O
in O
! O
-RRB- O
undergraduate O
courses O
that O
address O
these O
matters O
before O
you O
apply O
to O
a O
graduate O
program O
. O
If O
you O
majored O
in O
a O
technical O
field O
such O
as O
mathematics O
or O
physics O
, O
you O
may O
substitute O
the O
GRE O
subject O
test O
in O
that O
area O
for O
the O
CS O
Subject O
GRE O
. O
Can O
you O
tell O
me O
in O
advance O
what O
my O
chances O
are O
of O
being O
admitted O
? O
No O
. O
Many O
students O
ask O
us O
to O
do O
this O
, O
and O
if O
we O
acceded O
to O
all O
such O
requests O
, O
we O
would O
in O
essence O
be O
rehearsing O
the O
admissions O
process O
on O
the O
group O
that O
asked O
for O
advance O
notice O
. O
Not O
only O
would O
this O
be O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
, O
but O
the O
results O
would O
n't O
mean O
anything O
, O
since O
the O
outcome O
when O
we O
see O
all O
the O
candidates O
would O
likely O
be O
different O
. O
Applicants O
need O
to O
be O
aware O
that O
this O
is O
a O
small O
department O
admitting O
about O
8 O
new O
Ph.D. O
students O
, O
and O
from O
5 O
to O
15 O
new O
masters O
students O
each O
fall O
. O
What O
financial O
support O
is O
available O
for O
me O
? O
The O
Computer O
Science O
Department O
is O
committed O
to O
supporting O
Ph.D. O
students O
for O
five O
years O
, O
including O
summers O
, O
by O
combinations O
of O
grants O
, O
university O
fellowships O
, O
and O
teaching O
Assistantships O
. O
The O
support O
package O
for O
a O
student O
depends O
mainly O
on O
how O
much O
grant O
money O
his O
or O
her O
advisor O
has O
. O
There O
is O
no O
financial O
support O
for O
Masters O
Students O
, O
although O
the O
opportunity O
to O
TA O
is O
available O
occasionally O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
number O
of O
Ph.D. O
students O
who O
are O
available O
. O
Do O
a O
student O
's O
research O
interests O
affect O
his O
or O
her O
chance O
of O
being O
admitted O
? O
Yes O
, O
a O
little O
. O
We O
expect O
every O
student O
to O
be O
open O
to O
many O
facets O
of O
Computer O
Science O
when O
they O
arrive O
, O
and O
encourage O
them O
to O
feel O
free O
to O
change O
their O
area O
of O
concentration O
after O
they O
get O
here O
. O
Our O
main O
criterion O
for O
admission O
is O
the O
applicant O
's O
intelligence O
, O
curiosity O
, O
and O
ability O
to O
explore O
without O
detailed O
supervision O
. O
That O
said O
, O
if O
a O
faculty O
member O
in O
a O
research O
area O
is O
looking O
for O
students O
, O
the O
admissions O
committee O
tries O
to O
accommodate O
him O
or O
her O
by O
focusing O
a O
bit O
more O
than O
usual O
on O
applicants O
in O
that O
area O
. O
Of O
course O
, O
the O
applicants O
do O
n't O
know O
which O
areas O
fall O
in O
that O
category O
, O
so O
they O
should O
n't O
worry O
about O
it O
. O
Individual O
faculty O
members O
get O
many O
inquiries O
asking O
if O
they O
will O
be O
accepting O
new O
students O
during O
the O
next O
admissions O
season O
. O
As O
you O
should O
be O
able O
to O
infer O
from O
the O
previous O
paragraph O
, O
these O
inquiries O
are O
misguided O
; O
students O
are O
admitted O
to O
the O
department O
, O
not O
to O
the O
research O
group O
of O
a O
particular O
faculty O
member O
. O
Do O
applicants O
apply O
directly O
to O
the O
Ph.D. O
program O
, O
or O
are O
they O
expected O
to O
apply O
to O
the O
MS O
program O
, O
and O
from O
there O
be O
admitted O
to O
the O
Ph.D. O
program O
? O
Apply O
directly O
to O
the O
Ph.D. O
program O
. O
The O
two O
programs O
are O
completely O
separate O
, O
and O
it O
is O
unusual O
for O
a O
Master O
's O
student O
to O
go O
on O
to O
the O
Ph.D. O
program O
. O
If O
they O
choose O
to O
do O
so O
, O
they O
must O
reapply O
to O
the O
Graduate O
School O
. O
Is O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
admitted O
to O
the O
Master O
's O
program O
than O
the O
Ph.D. O
program O
? O
Yes O
. O
Can O
I O
be O
a O
part-time O
student O
? O
Yes O
for O
Master O
's O
students O
who O
are O
not O
on O
a O
visa O
, O
no O
for O
Ph.D. O
students O
. O
By O
US O
law O
, O
all O
students O
studying O
on O
a O
visa O
must O
be O
full-time O
. O
Where O
can O
I O
find O
out O
how O
to O
apply O
? O
Remember O
that O
you O
must O
apply O
to O
the O
Graduate O
School O
of O
Arts O
& O
Science O
. O
You O
do O
not O
apply O
directly O
to O
the O
Department O
of O
Computer O
Science O
nor O
do O
you O
send O
any O
forms O
to O
