Tips O
-LRB- O
read O
before O
you O
begin O
your O
application O
-RRB- O
We O
understand O
that O
proceeding O
with O
the O
application O
process O
for O
graduate O
studies O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
decision O
or O
something O
that O
should O
be O
considered O
lightly O
. O
To O
help O
you O
in O
making O
up O
your O
mind O
and O
give O
you O
some O
hints O
regarding O
the O
overall O
evaluation O
criteria O
, O
we O
provide O
a O
discussion O
of O
some O
of O
the O
relevant O
issues O
below O
. O
Note O
that O
there O
are O
many O
context-specific O
factors O
that O
influence O
the O
decision O
about O
an O
individual O
application O
, O
which O
are O
impossible O
to O
summarize O
in O
a O
coherent O
manner O
. O
However O
, O
the O
`` O
holistic O
review O
'' O
and O
the O
influential O
items O
in O
it O
can O
be O
described O
as O
follows O
: O
1 O
. O
Academic O
record O
: O
We O
do O
consider O
both O
the O
GPA O
and O
the O
institution O
. O
For O
example O
, O
the O
average O
GPA O
of O
the O
MS O
applicants O
admitted O
for O
the O
AY O
2012-2013 O
was O
approx O
. O
3.5 Igpa
/ O
4.0 O
. O
However O
, O
if O
someone O
has O
a O
GPA O
of O
, O
for O
example O
, O
3.5 O
/ O
4.0 O
but O
is O
coming O
from O
a O
top-10 O
university O
in O
a O
country O
with O
200 O
+ O
universities O
, O
it O
will O
be O
considered O
differently O
from O
the O
same O
GPA O
from O
an O
institution O
that O
is O
ranked O
in O
the O
top O
150 O
, O
for O
example O
. O
We O
do O
receive O
applications O
with O
transcripts O
using O
different O
GPA O
scales O
-LRB- O
10.0 O
; O
100 O
% O
; O
etc. O
. O
. O
-RRB- O
and O
we O
apply O
the O
adjusted O
criteria O
to O
such O
scales O
. O
As O
another O
specific O
example O
, O
many O
of O
the O
universities O
from O
India O
have O
a O
`` O
class-based O
'' O
evaluation O
scheme O
, O
and O
we O
note O
that O
we O
will O
always O
give O
priority O
to O
`` O
First O
Class O
with O
Distinction O
'' O
applicants O
. O
The O
application O
process O
does O
allow O
you O
to O
write O
the O
`` O
self-reported O
'' O
GPA O
on O
the O
scale O
of O
4.0 O
, O
however O
, O
we O
will O
always O
use O
the O
transcripts O
during O
evaluation O
process O
. O
Lastly O
, O
note O
that O
the O
evaluation O
is O
always O
`` O
relative O
'' O
-- O
i.e. O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
current O
pool O
of O
applicants O
. O
2 O
. O
Standardized O
test O
scores O
: O
Typically O
, O
all O
the O
admitted O
applicants O
have O
GRE-Q O
scores O
higher O
than O
760 O
-LRB- O
160 Igre
in O
the O
newer O
scale O
-RRB- O
; O
GRE-V O
scores O
higher O
than O
400 O
-LRB- O
146 Igre
in O
the O
newer O
scale O
-RRB- O
. O
It O
is O
often O
the O
case O
that O
US O
applicants O
score O
higher O
than O
the O
international O
ones O
on O
the O
GRE-AW O
portion O
, O
however O
, O
we O
will O
weigh O
the O
TOEFL O
score O
as O
a O
demonstration O
of O
the O
linguistic O
capabilities O
indicator O
for O
international O
applicants O
. O
More O
often O
than O
not O
-LRB- O
especially O
for O
PhD O
applicants O
-RRB- O
an O
EECS O
faculty O
interested O
in O
advising O
may O
conduct O
separate O
interviews O
, O
part O
of O
which O
will O
serve O
the O
purpose O
of O
attesting O
the O
English-speaking O
skills O
of O
a O
given O
applicant O
. O
3 O
. O
Statement O
of O
purpose O
: O
This O
part O
of O
the O
overall O
application O
carries O
an O
extremely O
important O
weight O
and O
the O
ones O
that O
are O
written O
in O
a O
clear O
and O
focused O
manner O
will O
be O
favored O
. O
Namely O
, O
upon O
reading O
it O
, O
an O
evaluator/faculty O
should O
get O
a O
crisp O
idea O
as O
to O
: O
Why O
is O
it O
that O
you O
would O
like O
to O
work O
in O
a O
particular O
major/specialization/topic O
and O
with O
a O
particular O
faculty O
as O
your O
adviser O
-LRB- O
for O
MS O
applicants O
this O
could O
be O
a O
project O
or O
thesis O
adviser O
-RRB- O
? O
Why O
is O
it O
that O
a O
particular O
faculty O
should O
be O
interested O
in O
having O
you O
as O
an O
advisee O
? O
In O
each O
case O
, O
a O
successful O
applicant O
will O
provide O
a O
good O
balance O
between O
background O
; O
vision O
; O
and O
desiderata O
. O
Example O
: O
simply O
saying O
that O
you O
like O
Northwestern O
or O
you O
have O
a O
high O
esteem O
for O
the O
faculty O
in O
the O
EECS O
-- O
aside O
from O
being O
flattering O
-- O
is O
not O
a O
statement O
which O
, O
in O
itself O
, O
will O
`` O
sell O
well O
'' O
. O
Lastly O
-- O
while O
this O
may O
not O
always O
be O
possible O
, O
it O
will O
be O
helpful O
if O
at O
least O
some O
-LRB- O
parts O
-RRB- O
of O
the O
recommendation O
letters O
can O
backup O
the O
claims O
made O
in O
the O
statement O
of O
purpose O
. O
Note O
that O
, O
typically O
, O
an O
applicant O
is O
given O
the O
option O
to O
explicitly O
provide O
the O
names O
of O
the O
faculty O
that O
-LRB- O
s O
-RRB- O
he O
would O
like O
to O
work O
with O
as O
part O
of O
the O
application O
process O
itself O
. O

. O
Letters O
of O
Recommendation O
: O
Make O
sure O
that O
, O
to O
whatever O
extent O
possible O
, O
the O
letters O
are O
stating O
something O
that O
distinguishes O
you O
-LRB- O
or O
, O
separates O
you O
-RRB- O
from O
the O
crowd O
. O
Example O
: O
if O
you O
think O
that O
a O
recommender O
will O
state O
something O
like O
` O
he O
was O
in O
the O
top O
25 O
% O
in O
my O
class O
' O
, O
try O
to O
find O
someone O
else O
to O
write O
you O
a O
letter O
of O
recommendation O
. O
As O
mentioned O
above O
, O
to O
whatever O
extent O
possible O
, O
these O
letters O
should O
reflect O
your O
capabilities O
listed O
in O
the O
statement O
of O
purpose O
. O
A O
minimum O
of O
two Irecommendation
letters O
is O
recommended O
but O
three Irecommendation
is O
highly O
recommended O

, O
research O
projects O
; O
leadership O
-RRB- O
-- O
however O
, O
the O
best O
place O
to O
put O
them O
in O
a O
coherent O
manner O
is O
your O
resume O
. O
Ideally O
, O
some O
