","If you have a strong background in computer science , mathematics , or a related field such as linguistics and you wish to do independent research in computer science in a highly competitive world-wide research environment , we encourage you to apply to our PhD program . ","If you are a computer professional or a novice to computer science and wish to gain a formal understanding of the principles and techniques of applied computer science , our Master 's Program may be the right choice for you . ","Is the PhD.program in computer science at the University of Chicago appropriate for me ? ","The key question is a match between your interests and faculty research . ","Please study our web-site to see which research group and which individual faculty members perform research to which you feel affinity . ","Another key question is how you feel about our formal requirements . ","Please study the web-page about these requirements . ","Do students in the PhD program receive a Master 's Degree ? ","Upon successful completion of the Course requirements and the presentation of a research-oriented Master 's paper , students in the PhD program receive a Master 's Degree . ","This concludes the first phase of their work toward their PhD and is expected to take two years . ","I do n't need a PhD but I 'd like to get the Master 's Degree in the PhD program . ","What do I do ? ","We do not offer the `` Master 's Degree in the PhD program '' as a separate program . ","Only students admitted into the PhD program are eligible for this avenue toward the Master 's Degree . ","If you are not interested in PhD-level research , you may want to consider our Master 's Program . ","I have years of experience with a number of programming languages in an industrial or business environment . ","I am a successful software engineer or systems analyst . ","Do I qualify for your PhD program ? ","This depends on your background and interest in performing PhD-level independent research in one of the areas of faculty interest . ","Please study our web-page to find out about the research areas pursued by our faculty . ","How do I apply ? ","An on-line application is now available . ","For a paper application , send email to admissions@cs.uchicago.edu . ","What is the deadline for applying to the PhD program ? ","The deadline is January 3rd . ","Late applications will be considered only if exceptional merit is demonstrated . ","What is the fee for applying to the PhD program ? ","The fee for applying to the PhD program is $ 55 . ","Is it necessary to contact a potential advisor before applying ? ","No , this is not necessary ; in fact , we ask you to refrain from doing so because of the high volume of applications . ","You are , however , encouraged to mention on your application form as well as in your Personal Statement any faculty members whose research appeals to you . ","The Admissions Committee assigns an initial advisor to each incoming student . ","Students can change advisors later , after personal interaction with our faculty . ","What are the requirements for application to the PhD program ? ","Completed application , including Statement of Purpose Three letters of recommendation Scanned copy of official transcripts GRE scores TOEFL scores -LRB- foreign applicants -RRB- Curriculum Vitae Any other supporting documentation you deem appropriate -LRB- e.g. , copies of authored papers , diplomas from student competitions -RRB- . ","What are the TOEFL score requirements ? ","Applicants whose first or native language is not English must demonstrate an adequate command of both spoken and written English , and they are required to submit English proficiency test scores as part of their application . ","We recognize the internet-based test -LRB- iBT -RRB- of the Test of English as a Foreign Language -LRB- TOEFL -RRB- and the International English Language Testing System -LRB- IELTS -RRB- . ","Applicants whose total score on the four-part TOEFL falls below 90 -LRB- or IELTS falls below 7 -RRB- will not normally be admitted unless other demonstrable evidence of proficiency in English is available . ","What are the minimum GRE and GPA scores ? ","What we are most interested in is the applicant 's research potential . ","These scores are just one of many criteria we consider . ","There are no minimum scores . ","We much prefer students who have taken challenging advanced courses to those with top scores on rudimentary courses . ","There are many ways for applicants to demonstrate their research potential . ","What are the ETS GRE codes ? ","Our GRE institution code is 1832 and our department code is 0402 . ","What should I write about in my Statement of Purpose ? ","There are no rules about this . ","Make it as informative as you can . ","We love to hear details about your background , about your career so far , about your goals , about your research interests , about your reasons for choosing certain areas of research , about your reasons for choosing the University of Chicago , and any other thoughts you wish to share with us . ","I participated in student competitions . ","What do I need to write about them ? ","Please mention your participation and achievement in your Statement of Purpose . ","Please give a precise indication of what your achievement meant . ","We 'd like to know the organization running the competition and the population of the area from where students were eligible to participate . ","If you received a prize , we 'd like to know how many students shared each prize . ","We 'd also like to know if there is a web-site where some of these data can be verified . ","It is also helpful if one of the letters of recommendation explicitly verifies your statements . ","I have published research . ","What documentation do I need to provide ? ","Please send us a copy . ","If the publication is not in English , an English translation is helpful . ","If the publication appeared in a local outlet not easily found in American libraries , it is helpful if at least one of your letters of recommendation specifically comments on the nature of the publication -LRB- student publication , major publication of new research , etc. -RRB- . ","I did not participate in student competitions and I have not done any research yet . ","Do I have any chance of admission to your PhD program ? ","Participation in student competitions and having a prior research record are not required for admission to our PhD program ; in fact , only a fraction of our current graduate students had such background at the time they applied to our program . ","The key to admission is your research potential as perceived by our Admissions Committee through the examination of all documents in your application material . ","My grades are less than stellar . ","Do you care to know why ? ","What we are interested in is not grades but research potential ; grades are but one indicator . ","A lower grade in a challenging course is worth more than a perfect grade in an easy or irrelevant course . ","If you feel your grades do not reflect your academic potential , please let us know why . ","How precisely do I need to specify my research interests ? ","We do not expect that applicants have decided upon a precise thesis topic . ","Applicants tend to have a preference for one or more of the broad areas of research pursued by the faculty in our department . ","Please look at our web-page for departmental research for up-to-date information about faculty research . ","Tell us why you prefer a particular area . ","If I state a preferred area of research , can I later change this ? ","We fully expect students ' interests to change over time , partly in response to their interaction with our faculty . ","-LRB- Please note that our faculty 's interests also change . -RRB- ","Preferences you express in your Statement of Purpose will not be binding on you , they simply give us a chance to know more about you at the time of application . ","How are PhD students funded ? ","Students enrolled in the Ph.D. program receive a stipend from the department as long as they make satisfactory progress toward their degree . ","The stipend is more than adequate to cover a student 's typical living expenses , and also covers tuition . ","In return , students have to perform services for the department , most often as Teaching Assistants . ","Some advanced students may be funded by their advisor 's research grant as Research Assistants for varying periods of time depending on the student 's progress and on grant availability . ","During the periods of such funding , no service to the Department is required . ","For how many years do I get funded ? ","Funding depends on satisfactory progress toward your degree . ","Students are expected to graduate in five years or less . ","If sufficient progress is demonstrated , the faculty may extend funding through a sixth year . ","After the sixth year , support from the department is not generally available . ","Would I have the opportunity to teach ? ","The department takes its undergraduate teaching responsibilities very seriously , and offers supervised teaching opportunities to the graduate students . ","Most graduate students will act as teaching assistants or work as lab assistants ; a small number of qualifying graduate students will act as lecturers . ","The department also works with other University departments to make campus-wide teaching seminars available to its students . ","How do I prepare for my duties as a Teaching Assistant ? ","Please check our undergraduate course descriptions . ","You are likely to teach a course with a course number beginning 10 , 11 , or 12 . ","You may need to master specific programming languages such as C++ and Scheme to be able to perform your teaching duties . ","When do the PhD studies begin ? ","Classes start in the third or fourth week of September . ","Is it possible to enter the PhD program in Winter or Spring ? ","Our program starts in Autumn . ","Only in cases of exceptional merit do we consider exceptions to this rule . ","If I need more information , how do I obtain it ? ","Your primary source of information is our web-site . ","Please study all aspects of it ; especially the PhD requirements , the departmental research and the profiles of the individual faculty members . ","If , after having studied these web sources , you still have further questions , you may write to admissions@cs.uchicago.edu . ","Please keep your message short . ","Due to the large volume of incoming mail , long messages and messages containing attachments run the risk of not being read .
