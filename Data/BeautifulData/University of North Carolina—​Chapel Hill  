","Although we welcome promising students from all disciplines , entering students must have a substantial background in both mathematics and computer science . ","This background normally includes at least six semester courses in mathematics and six in computer science . ","We consider knowledge of the following subjects to be essential preparation for our graduate program : differential and integral calculus ; discrete mathematics : sets , relations , functions , algebra ; linear algebra or matrix theory ; mathematical probability , preferably calculus-based ; structured programming techniques ; data structures and abstract data types ; computer organization . ","Most entering students have studied all but two or three of the following subjects , which are required preparation for our graduate program : design and analysis of algorithms ; formal languages and automata theory ; databases ; operating systems ; compilers ; digital logic techniques ; numerical computing methods ; programming languages ; software engineering . ","Students who are admitted but who have not completed all the requirements must complete them after admission . ","Preference is given to applicants who are solidly prepared , especially in mathematics . ","Previous Degrees A baccalaureate degree is required , with a grade point average of at least B -LRB- 3.0 \/ 4.0 -RRB- ; most entering students have a GPA of more than 3.5 . ","GRE High scores on all three parts of the General Aptitude Test of the Graduate Record Examination are also recommended : a minimum of 80th percentile on the verbal section , 90th percentile on the quantitative section , and 90th percentile on the analytical section or a minimum of 5 on the analytical writing section . ","In recent years , most entering students have averaged in the 90th percentile or higher on each of the three sections . ","Allowances are made in interpreting the verbal test scores of applicants whose native language is not English . ","Although GRE Advanced Test scores are not required , applicants are encouraged to take the advanced test in computer science , mathematics , engineering , or physics , as appropriate . ","Standardized test scores must be officially reported directly by the Educational Testing Service -LRB- ETS -RRB- and no more than five years old . ","The official report of your score must arrive before admission can be offered . ","If you did not specify the UNC-CH Graduate School institution code # 5816 as a score recipient at the time of taking the test , or if your scores were sent more than one year ago , you must contact ETS to request that your scores are sent to us . ","No departmental code is required . ","TOEFL Please see http:\/\/gradschool.unc.edu\/admissions\/instructions.html#intlÂ for TOEFL information and minimum scores . ","We give preference to applicants who score above a 615 on the paper-based TOEFL exam . ","Personal Statement Each applicant must submit a short personal statement . ","This statement is considered the departmental supplemental application and should include : objectives in pursuing graduate study ; identification of fields within computer science in which the applicant has a particular interest ; information that is relevant to the applicant 's qualifications for graduate study but that has not been included already in the application -LRB- e.g. major academic projects , papers presented or published , and non-academic computer experience -RRB- ; an informative title or a brief description of any course listed on the applicant 's transcript without a title -LRB- or with a vague title such as `` Mathematics II '' -RRB- ; a list of all courses taken or planned that do not yet appear on a transcript ; an e-mail address , if available . ","It should be between a half page and two pages long . ","Electronic submission of the personal statement is required by the application software . ","Recommendations Three letters of recommendation are required . ","Letters written by an applicant 's present or former professors are usually more informative than those written by employers or colleagues . ","Electronic submission of all three recommendations is required by the application software . ","Sponsorship Because of the large number of applicants , the department 's faculty members are unable to provide individual assessments of an applicant 's chances for admission . ","Applicants can not improve their chances of admission by finding a faculty sponsor within the department , because all admissions decisions are made by a faculty committee that reviews all applications , ranks the applicants by overall merit , and makes decisions on admission and financial support based on the application material submitted . ","In particular , students are not admitted by research project directors ; contacting individual faculty members whose research is of interest has no effect on one 's chances of being admitted . ","How To Apply Admission is based solely on merit . ","The University of North Carolina is an affirmative action , equal opportunity institution . ","Prospective applicants who clearly surpass the minimum requirements are encouraged to apply . ","The Graduate School 's web site includes information on applying and on-line application forms.http : \/ \/ gradschool.unc.edu\/admissions\/instructions.html If you do not have internet access and need to request a paper application , write for application materials to : The Graduate School The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Campus Box 4010 , 200 Bynum Hall Chapel Hill , N.C. 27599-4010 USA Phone : -LRB-919-RRB-Â 966-2611 Internet mail : gradinfo@unc.edu Web : http:\/\/gradschool.unc.edu Admissions Deadlines Applications for Fall 2014 admission , complete with a personal statement , all transcripts , three letters of recommendation , and official GRE and\/or TOEFL scores will be accepted by the Graduate School and reviewed by the department until April 14 , 2015 .
