","Refer to the Graduate Council website for additional details regarding the Doctoral Qualifying Examination at http:\/\/gradstudies.ucdavis.edu\/gradcouncil\/policiesall.html 8 -RRB- Qualifying Examination and Dissertation Requirements Qualifying Examination General Information To be eligible for the Qualifying Examination , the student must have satisfied all course requirements , have removed all undergraduate deficiencies , and must have at least a 3.5 GPA in courses taken in the program of study . ","Passing this exam makes the student eligible for advancement to candidacy . ","The Qualifying Exam should be taken by the ninth quarter and no later than the end of the fifteenth quarter after admission to the Ph.D. program . ","The primary purpose of the Qualifying Examination is to validate that the student is academically qualified to conceptualize a research topic , undertake scholarly research , and successfully produce the dissertation required for a doctoral degree . ","The Qualifying Exam must evaluate the student 's command of the field , ensuring that the student has both breadth and depth of knowledge . ","It must not focus solely on the proposed dissertation research . ","In addition , the Qualifying Exam provides an opportunity for the committee to provide important guidance to the student regarding his or her chosen research topic . ","The Qualifying Examination is a formal , oral examination to ascertain the student 's readiness to conduct Ph.D.-level research in the major area of study . ","Written portion of the qualifying exam : the Thesis Proposal Prior to the Qualifying Examination the student must prepare a Thesis Proposal containing a thorough discussion of a proposed thesis topic . ","This paper must be submitted to the Qualifying Examination Committee at least two weeks prior to the examination . ","The Thesis Proposal is an independently prepared proposal describing the student 's dissertation-specific research aims , hypotheses , progress to date , and experimental approach . ","Concepts within the research proposal can be discussed with others -LRB- such as the student 's Thesis Advisor and peers -RRB- , but the writing of the proposal should be solely the student 's work , as the proposal will also serve as evidence of the student 's proficiency in scientific writing The Qualifying Exam Committee is responsible for assessing that the student 's scholarly preparation and writing proficiency are satisfactory before advancement to candidacy . ","Furthermore , the Thesis Proposal will provide information that may be discussed during the oral exam . ","Oral portion of the exam The oral portion of the qualifying exam will be 2-3 hours in length . ","The examinations differ in structure , depending on the area of research and the members of the examining committee . ","The student will be asked to give a formal presentation of the thesis proposal . ","The committee will question the student on this proposal , and will question the student to determine the student 's competence in both the major and minor areas of study . ","The committee will evaluate the student 's general qualifications for a position in academia or in industry , the student 's preparation in his\/her specific area of study , the student 's previous academic record , performance on specific parts of the examination , and the student 's potential for scholarly research as indicated during the examination and in the student 's publication history . ","Outcome of the exam The committee can issue any of the following grades for the examination : Pass -- In this case student can apply to the Graduate Studies for Advancement to Candidacy for the degree . ","At this time a dissertation committee is officially selected to direct the student in the research , and to guide the student in the preparation of the dissertation . ","The committee must be approved by Graduate Studies.Not Pass -- In this case , the committee has two options : 1 . ","It can decide that the student 's Thesis Proposal is not sufficient and ask that it be re-thought or re-written . ","In this case , the committee will ask the student to remedy the problems in the proposal and retake the examination within a specified time frame . ","2 . ","It can decide that the student 's knowledge within the major and minor areas is not sufficient for continued progress for the Ph.D. . ","In this case , the committee can ask the student to take some additional coursework and retake the examination within a specified time frame.Fail -- In this case , the student is not permitted to continue in the Ph.D. program . ","The student can only retake the Qualifying Examination once . ","If a passing grade is not achieved by the second attempt , the student can not continue in the Ph.D. program.If a unanimous decision takes the form of `` Not Pass '' or `` Fail '' , the Chair of the Qualifying Exam Committee must include in its report a specific statement , agreed to by all members of the committee , explaining its decision , the Chair must inform the student of its decision . ","Having received a `` Not Pass '' the student may attempt the Qualifying Exam one additional time ; the Qualifying Exam report must list the specific conditions and timing for the second exam . ","After a second examination , a vote of `` Not Pass '' is unacceptable ; only `` Pass '' or `` Fail '' is recognized . ","Should the student receive a `` Fail '' on the first or second attempt at the exam , the student will be recommended for disqualification from the program to the Dean of Graduate Studies . ","The Dissertation General requirementsThe Ph.D. dissertation demonstrates the ability of the student to carry out an independent original research project of high quality . ","It reflects a level of attainment in research , not the fulfillment of a list of requirements . ","An acceptable Ph.D. dissertation is not only an original contribution to the field , but is generally characterized by a broad scope of applicability . ","The dissertation must be submitted to each member of the dissertation committee at least one month before the student expects to make requested revisions ; committee members are expected to respond within four weeks , not including summer months for nine-month faculty . ","Informing committee members of progress as writing proceeds helps the members to plan to read the dissertation and provide feedback within this timeframe . ","The dissertation must be approved and signed by all members of the Dissertation Committee before it is submitted to Graduate Studies for final approval.Filing of the Dissertation with the Office of Graduate Studies is normally the last requirement satisfied by the candidate . ","The deadlines for completing this requirement are listed each quarter in the campus General Catalog -LRB- available online at the website of the Office of the Registrar or from the Bookstore -RRB- . ","A candidate must be a registered student or on Filing Fee status at the time of filing a dissertation , with the exception of the summer period between the end of the Spring Quarter and the beginning of Fall Quarter . ","The Dissertation will be prepared , submitted and filed according to regulations instituted by the Office of Graduate Studies http:\/\/gradstudies.ucdavis.edu\/students\/filing.html . ","Satisfaction of this requirement must be verified by the Dissertation Committee Chair . ","Exit SeminarEach student is required to participate in an Exit Seminar , in which the candidate 's research is presented to the UC Davis academic community . ","This seminar will be administered by the Dissertation Committee and will take place after all committee members have approved the dissertation , but before the dissertation has been filed with the Office of Graduate Studies . ","Adequate scheduling of the Exit Seminar is the responsibility of the student . ","9 -RRB- Normative Time to Degree It is expected that the student will complete the undergraduate proficiency requirements within the first four quarters of study , the Advanced Proficiency within the first six quarters of study , and the Qualifying Examination between the sixth and ninth quarters of study . ","Completion of all requirements is normally accomplished in fifteen quarters of study . ","The maximal time period allowed for completion of each requirement is as follows . ","A student 's Program of Study must be submitted and approved by the end of four quarters of study . ","The student must complete the Advanced Proficiency Requirements by the end of the sixth quarter of study . ","The student must complete the Qualifying Examination by the end of the ninth quarter of study . ","The student should complete all requirements for the Ph.D. by the end of the 15th quarter of study . ","Students who fail to complete all the requirements within the `` normal '' time period are referred to the Educational Policy Committee of the Graduate Group . ","The Committee considers the student 's entire record , including examination scores and letters of support , particularly from the student 's Thesis Advisor . ","The Committee exercises wide discretion : it may decide that no action is necessary ; that the student should be allowed more time in which to complete the requirement ; that certain of the requirements should be waived ; that certain remedial actions should be taken ; or that the student should be advised to leave the program . ","The committee attaches great weight to the Thesis Advisor 's letter of support . ","It is therefore extremely important that students involve themselves in research under some faculty member early in the program -- preferably by the end of their third quarter .
