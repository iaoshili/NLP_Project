","Information about the MacCracken program can be found by clicking the link to `` Guidelines '' at http:\/\/gsas.nyu.edu\/page\/grad.financialaid.gradfellowships More than half of Computer Science PhD students receive support from research assistantships associated with external grants received by their research advisors . ","There are also opportunities for MacCracken fellows to receive additional compensation separate from their MacCracken award by serving as instructional assistants . ","Prospective PhD students are strongly encouraged to apply for external fellowships .
