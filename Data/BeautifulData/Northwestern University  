","Any applications submitted will not be accepted and be automatically denied . ","If you would like to apply for PhD admission , you can do so for the Fall 2016 admission cycle at the earliest . ","Our application system will re-open to accept applications in early September , 2015 Who should apply ? ","A person may apply to the doctoral program with either a 4-year BS , BA , or a master 's degree in a relevant field . ","Persons with 3-year technical degrees are generally not allowed to apply for graduate study at Northwestern University . ","Who should NOT apply ? ","A current Northwestern University EECS M.S. student should NOT apply to our Ph.D. program . ","For such a student , continuation to the Ph.D. in our EECS Department is only by recommendation and invitation of the student 's EECS faculty adviser . ","If such a recommendation and invitation is made , the faculty adviser will take care of all of the needed paperwork . ","The student must NOT submit a completely new application for admission to TGS . ","When to apply M.S. and Ph.D. applicants should apply to begin only in the Fall Quarter . ","Note that we only allow for Fall admits to both programs . ","Winter and Spring Quarter admission requests by M.S. and Ph.D. applicants will be automatically denied , in general . ","The only mechanism for Winter or Spring Quarter Ph.D. admission involves the intervention of one of our faculty , who must agree to support the student in question as a research assistant for the remainder of the academic year . ","To explore this possibility , an applicant should contact individual professors listed in the EECS Department 's faculty directory . ","You can view a great deal of general information about requirements and policies at TGS - The Graduate School For more info , please contact the EECS Department Graduate Office . ","Application Deadlines and Important Dates Applications for the 2015-2016 academic year will became available on September 2 , 2014 on the Apply Yourself application website . ","PhD The deadline for PhD applicants is December 31 , 2014 -LRB- for Fall 2015 -RRB- Most of the decisions are typically finalized by the end of March , but some decisions may be made as late as April 15 . ","MS The deadline for M.S. applicants for Fall 2015 is May 1 , 2015 . ","The absolute deadlines regarding certain admissions-related actions by TGS are available here . ","TOEFL Requirements The required minimum scores for PhD students - 90 IBT -LRB- Internet-based test -RRB- , 233 CBT -LRB- computer-based test -RRB- , and 577 PBT -LRB- paper-based test -RRB- . ","The required minimum scores for MS students - 80 IBT , 213 CBT , and 550 PBT . ","Tips -LRB- read before you begin your application -RRB- We understand that proceeding with the application process for graduate studies is not an easy decision or something that should be considered lightly . ","To help you in making up your mind and give you some hints regarding the overall evaluation criteria , we provide a discussion of some of the relevant issues below . ","Note that there are many context-specific factors that influence the decision about an individual application , which are impossible to summarize in a coherent manner . ","However , the `` holistic review '' and the influential items in it can be described as follows : 1 . ","Academic record : We do consider both the GPA and the institution . ","For example , the average GPA of the MS applicants admitted for the AY 2012-2013 was approx . ","3.5 \/ 4.0 . ","However , if someone has a GPA of , for example , 3.5 \/ 4.0 but is coming from a top-10 university in a country with 200 + universities , it will be considered differently from the same GPA from an institution that is ranked in the top 150 , for example . ","We do receive applications with transcripts using different GPA scales -LRB- 10.0 ; 100 % ; etc. . . -RRB- ","and we apply the adjusted criteria to such scales . ","As another specific example , many of the universities from India have a `` class-based '' evaluation scheme , and we note that we will always give priority to `` First Class with Distinction '' applicants . ","The application process does allow you to write the `` self-reported '' GPA on the scale of 4.0 , however , we will always use the transcripts during evaluation process . ","Lastly , note that the evaluation is always `` relative '' -- i.e. , in terms of the current pool of applicants . ","2 . ","Standardized test scores : Typically , all the admitted applicants have GRE-Q scores higher than 760 -LRB- 160 in the newer scale -RRB- ; GRE-V scores higher than 400 -LRB- 146 in the newer scale -RRB- . ","It is often the case that US applicants score higher than the international ones on the GRE-AW portion , however , we will weigh the TOEFL score as a demonstration of the linguistic capabilities indicator for international applicants . ","More often than not -LRB- especially for PhD applicants -RRB- an EECS faculty interested in advising may conduct separate interviews , part of which will serve the purpose of attesting the English-speaking skills of a given applicant . ","3 . ","Statement of purpose : This part of the overall application carries an extremely important weight and the ones that are written in a clear and focused manner will be favored . ","Namely , upon reading it , an evaluator\/faculty should get a crisp idea as to : Why is it that you would like to work in a particular major\/specialization\/topic and with a particular faculty as your adviser -LRB- for MS applicants this could be a project or thesis adviser -RRB- ? ","Why is it that a particular faculty should be interested in having you as an advisee ? ","In each case , a successful applicant will provide a good balance between background ; vision ; and desiderata . ","Example : simply saying that you like Northwestern or you have a high esteem for the faculty in the EECS -- aside from being flattering -- is not a statement which , in itself , will `` sell well '' . ","Lastly -- while this may not always be possible , it will be helpful if at least some -LRB- parts -RRB- of the recommendation letters can backup the claims made in the statement of purpose . ","Note that , typically , an applicant is given the option to explicitly provide the names of the faculty that -LRB- s -RRB- he would like to work with as part of the application process itself . ","4 . ","Letters of Recommendation : Make sure that , to whatever extent possible , the letters are stating something that distinguishes you -LRB- or , separates you -RRB- from the crowd . ","Example : if you think that a recommender will state something like ` he was in the top 25 % in my class ' , try to find someone else to write you a letter of recommendation . ","As mentioned above , to whatever extent possible , these letters should reflect your capabilities listed in the statement of purpose . ","A minimum of two letters is recommended but three is highly recommended . ","5 . ","Miscellaneous : We will value all your achievements -LRB- e.g. , awards received on competitions -RRB- and experiences -LRB- e.g. , research projects ; leadership -RRB- -- however , the best place to put them in a coherent manner is your resume . ","Ideally , some of these item should also be properly linked with the statement of purpose document .
